#Unrolled generative adversarial networks: reduces the probability of mode collapse by playing 'k' number of steps for how the generator can be optimized
#At each step, gradient descent is used,
#To summarize, the Unrolled GAN uses the cost function calculated in the last step to perform the backpropagation for the generator while the discriminator uses the first step only.
